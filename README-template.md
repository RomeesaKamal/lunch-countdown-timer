### What I learned

Through building the lunch countdown timer project, I learned how to create a functional and interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained experience in working with JavaScript‚Äôs setInterval function to manage the countdown and update the timer in real-time. Additionally, I improved my skills in designing user-friendly interfaces and integrating dynamic features, such as a countdown timer, into a web project.

### Continued development

- **Dynamic Lunch Time**: Allow users to set their own lunch time for a more personalized experience.
- **Notifications**: Implement a notification system (sound or pop-up) when it's lunch time.
- **Pause/Resume Timer**: Add controls to pause, resume, or reset the countdown timer.
- **Theming Options**: Enable customizable themes to enhance the user interface.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Improve accessibility for users with visual or auditory impairments.

### What I learned

Through building the lunch countdown timer project, I learned how to create a functional and interactive web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I gained experience in working with JavaScriptâ€™s setInterval function to manage the countdown and update the timer in real-time. Additionally, I improved my skills in designing user-friendly interfaces and integrating dynamic features, such as a countdown timer, into a web project.
